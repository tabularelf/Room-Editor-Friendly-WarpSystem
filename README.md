# Room-Editor-Friendly-WarpSystem

An example of a better warp system that smartly teleports you to a specific location within your rooms, without having to mess around with magic numbers.
It relies on existing obj_warp objects to grab & set their destination.

It includes a bunch of failsafes to ensure that you always end up "somewhere".

The main purpose of this system is to utilize Variable Definitions, so the developer can focus more time on using the room editor and less time out of creation code.
Speeding up overall production of the entire game. :D
